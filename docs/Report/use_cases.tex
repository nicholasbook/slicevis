\chapter{Use Cases}

What can slicevis be used for? Example data is repo. Refer to license. 

\section{Whole-Body Murine CT Scans}

225 whole-body CT scans of lab mice. Two different resolutions.

Manual segmentations of all mayor organs included. By two trained experts.

GFF metadata includes name and color of each class. 

Screenshots of representative slices.

\section{The Cancer Imaging Archive}

95 CT scans of human upper bodies.

Republished as part of the Medical Segmentation Decathlon.

Very high resolution.

Labels of lung nodules included. Segmented by trained radiologist. 

Perfect for the training of CNNs.

\section{nnU-Net Prediction Validation}

Winning model of Decathlon challenge. Accuracy of 69\% for lung task.

Pre-trained model weights available for download. Network can be installed under Linux.

Prediction on one of the training cases is included in the repo. The aim is to validate the prediction using the DICE score.

Explain the DICE score. 

Automatically computed once a validation segmentation is loaded.
